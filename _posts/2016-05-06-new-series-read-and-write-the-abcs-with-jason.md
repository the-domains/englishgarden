# New series! Read & write the ABCs with Jason.

For our younger students, [we've started publishing a new series][0] to teach the reading and writing of English letters.

Each video follows the same pattern, so that students can understand it even though it's in a foreign language:

* 1\. an example of the letter in the real world--
* 2\. the English Garden intro animation--
* 3\. Jason says which letter we're studying today--
* 4\. an animation showing how to write the uppercase and lowercase versions of the letter--
* 5\. a video showing how to read the letter, and which common words the letter appears in (made with the Adobe Voice app)--
* 6\. and at the end of the Adobe Voice video, there is a simple quiz that students can try out by pausing the video and thinking about the question.

The videos are designed to be fun, quick ways to get your children listening to and repeating English at home. We hope you enjoy!
